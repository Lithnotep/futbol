Welcome to our Stat Tracker. This program, takes in a set of data about a soccer league, in the form of 3 csv files and organizes that data.

We have 8 classes, 3 for collection creation for each CSV file, 4 for organization of each statistic type and one Superclass.  

Our parent class, called Statistics, contains methods to access each of our collections which is functionality that all of its children classes need.

We have two Modules. The Keyable module includes a method that takes in a Hash and returns the key linked to the highest value in that hash. The Averageable module includes a method that is used to return the average of two values.
